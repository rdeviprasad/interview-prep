Intersection: Given two straight line segments (represented as a start point and an end point), compute the point of intersection, if any.

Word Frequencies: Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?

Tic Tac Win: Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe.

Factorial Zeroes: Write an algorithm which computes the number of trailing zeroes in n factorial.

Smallest Difference: Given  two arrays of integers, compute the pair of values (one value in each array) with the smallest (non-negative) difference. Return the difference.

Example:
Input : [1, 3, 15, 11, 2], [23, 127, 235, 19, 8]
Output: 3. That is, the pair (11, 8)
